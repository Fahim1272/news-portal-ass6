                    <div>
                        Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line
                        strings, for string interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special constructs called
                        tagged templates.

                    <h3 class="text-primary">2. Difference between var, let and const :-</h3>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                        <b>Var:</b> Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues associated with
                        variables declared with var, though. That is why it was necessary for new ways to declare
                        variables to emerge.
                        <br>
                        <b>Const:</b> Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations
                        share some similarities with let declarations. Const is block scope too.
                        <br>
                        <b>Let:</b> let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an
                        improvement to var declarations. Let is block scope.
                        <br>

                    <h3 class="text-primary">3. Difference between map, forEach, filter,find :-</h3>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                        <b>Filter:</b> The main difference between forEach and filter is that forEach just loop over the
                        array and executes the callback but filter executes the callback and check its return value.
                        <br>
                        <b>ForEach:</b> Foreach takes a callback function and run that callback function on each element
                        of array one by one.
                        <br>
                        <b>Reduce : </b> As the name already suggest reduce method of the array object is used to reduce
                        the array to one single value.
                        <b>Map : </b> Map like filter & foreach takes a callback and run it against every element on the
                        array but whats makes it unique is it generate a new array based on your existing array.
                        <br>

                    <br>
                    <div>
                        <b>Arrow function:</b> Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature
                        introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. While both
                        regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner, there are certain
                        differences between them.
                        <br>
                        <b>Regular function:</b> We can call both function declaration and expression as Normal/Regular
                        Function
